            <h2>Who I Am</h2>
            <p>I'm Victoria Edorh, the mind behind this unique fusion. With roots in the vibrant city of Lagos, Nigeria, my journey has taken me from the structured world of accounting to the boundless realms of technology and gastronomy. Currently, I'm venturing into the intricate world of full-stack development with CapacityBay, driven by a mission to craft digital solutions that resonate globally. Parallel to my tech endeavors, I've cultivated a deep appreciation for culinary arts. Cooking, for me, is a creative outlet, a way to nourish both body and soul. At Picnic-codes, I blend these passions, offering a glimpse into how technology and cooking intersect.</p>
            <p>My aim? To inspire innovation and creativity, urging you to explore and blend your diverse interests. Join me on this flavorful journey of code and cuisine at Picnic-codes, where every project is an adventure and every dish tells a story.</p>
